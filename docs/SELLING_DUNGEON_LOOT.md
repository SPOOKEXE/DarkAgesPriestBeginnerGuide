## Selling Loot

Each vender buys different items. Some buy at better rates than others, so you'll have to investigate each shop to see whether they are buying your materials at the best price (if you want to get the max reward).

For example, the black witch den shop at the top bought my spider eyes.

Getting 500 coins for one spider eye, seems great!

Cian next door in the potion shop bought my moldy bread and mold.

You can walk around to each shop when you get different types of loot to see where you can sell it for the most!
