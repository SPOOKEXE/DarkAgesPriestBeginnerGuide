## Start of your journey

The first goal of any character is to level up a few times to level 6. This'll let you unlock a few spells.

This means you will be entering the dungeon. You can do this solo or you can team up with other individuals to level even faster.

You can additionally choose to get a spell right now, but for now we'll focus on leveling up.

Head to the dungeon marked on the map below:

To begin the dungeon, walk down these stairs.

You can attack mice by spamming right click, then left click and drag loot to your free inventory slots.

Grind this dungeon until your level 6.
